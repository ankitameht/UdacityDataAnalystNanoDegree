Q1: Describe a data project you worked on recently.
Ans:



Q2: You are given a ten piece box of chocolate truffles. You know based on the label that six of the pieces have an orange cream filling and four of the pieces have a coconut filling. If you were to eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that the first two pieces you eat have an orange cream filling and the last two have a coconut filling?

Follow-up question: If you were given an identical box of chocolates and again eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that exactly two contain coconut filling?
Ans:


Q3: Given the table users:

     Table "users"
+-------------+-----------+
| Column      | Type      |
+-------------+-----------+
| id          | integer   |
| username    | character |
| email       | character |
| city        | character |
| state       | character |
| zip         | integer   |
| active      | boolean   |
+-------------+-----------+
construct a query to find the top 5 states with the highest number of active users. Include the number for each state in the query result. Example result:
+------------+------------------+
| state      | num_active_users |
+------------+------------------+
| New Mexico | 502              |
| Alabama    | 495              |
