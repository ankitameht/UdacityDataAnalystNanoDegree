## Summary

I wish to demonstrate the growth of Facebook (in terms of active users) over the last decade and how it coincides their revenue, major feature launches and acquisitions. To do so, I collected a dataset for facebook with 'Year', 'FacebookActiveUsers', and 'Revenue' as the columns. I also highlighted some key feature launches and acquisitions.

## Design
Taking the last ten years data (2008-2017), I decided that it would be interesting to see Facebook's retention (in terms of number of active users) and their revenue growth. 

####Dataset collection
I realised that since this data was available over Facebook's wikipedia page; I created a csv dataset to store the information. In order to get the get the major feature launches and acquisition information, Facebook's website was my resort.

####Visualization design
Since this was a time series data, I opted for line and bar graph. I decided to use two y-axis to highlight the revenue, allowing me to simultaneously show revenue and retention (active users) growth in a single chart. Finally I decided to use dimple plot bubbles to show major events.

### Hand Sketch
The initial design was as follows:

This was my intial thought on the visualization. I would like to compare Number of active users as a bar graph and compare it with Number of Internet users worldwide (as line plot). My intention was to see if there are any unseen relevance between these.
